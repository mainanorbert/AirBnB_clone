# AirBnB clone - The console

The AirBNB prohect aims to replicate the functionality and user experience of the popular Airbnb platform. Whether you're a traveler looking for accommodation or a host looking to rent out your space, our Airbnb Clone provides a familiar and user-friendly platform for your needs.The AirBNB Clone is composed of the following:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
